//TODO Serialization is the process of translating data structures or
	// object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or
	// memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and
	// reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.[1] When
	// the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization
	// format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the
	// original object.
